the contents of the MemoryStream stream are filled with a byte array, based on text information from the source file using the StreamReader class;
the function of the contents of the file to another, using the buffering capabilities of the FileStream class, the function must return the number of bytes written;
the function of the content of the tetative file to another, using the capabilities of the decorator class. BufferedStream, the function must return the number of bytes written;
The function of copying the contents of one the other file to another using the MemoryStream class as a stream with a backup; the function must return the number of bytes written;
